## Description

Journey across the six realms of Elchess to acquire all chess pieces and become the Greatmaster of Elchess.

This game will feature a:

* Chess Puzzle Simulator  - Solve chess puzzles to battle against randomly encountered enemies and bosses.
    * Example 1: Solve 1 chess puzzle equates to dealing 1 damage against an enemy.
    * Example 2: Take 1 damage when failing a chess puzzle.
* Text-based RPG - Explore the world of Elchess with text-based commands. Explore dungeons, biomes, and interact with the denizens of Elchess to uncover its secrets.
    * Example 1: You wake up in a dark cave, alone, where you can see a light in the distance, where do you go? A: Follow the light;  B: Do Nothing; C: Go deeper into the cave....
* Accept inputs via an external chat interface (like Zoom or Twitch) to enable crowdplay


Bonus features (if we have time):

* Variations or additional features to the game of Chess itself
* Expansions to the RPG aspects
* Other minigames

Challenges:
* None of us know Chess well. We would all need to do heavy research on the subject before diving in.
* Worldbuilding and script writing would be a large undertaking on top of the coding requirement of building a text-based RPG
* The sheer volume of Chess puzzles needed to keep the randomizer for "battles" fresh, on top of needed classification into various stages of difficulty for each of the "realms"
